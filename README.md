**Turn your rough course ideas into structured curriculums and technical delivery plans.**

The `curriculum-designer` is a powerful agentic skill for the **Gemini CLI**. It acts as an expert instructional designer, interviewing you to build high-quality educational content and then generating the technical roadmap to build it.

## 📦 Installation & Setup

### 0. Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have **Node.js** and the **Gemini CLI** installed.

1.  **Install Node.js:** Download and install the latest LTS version from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). This includes `npm`.
2.  **Install Gemini CLI:**
    ```bash
    npm install -g @google/gemini-cli
    ```

### 1. Install the Skill
You can install this skill globally via NPM.

```bash
npm install -g @weihaoqu/curriculum-designer-skill
```

### 2. Register with Gemini CLI
Tell your Gemini agent to use the installed skill.

```bash
# Option A: From your local NPM installation
gemini skills install $(npm root -g)/@weihaoqu/curriculum-designer-skill --scope user

# Option B: Directly from GitHub
gemini skills install https://github.com/weihaoqu/gemini-curriculum-designer --scope user
```

### 3. Verify Installation
To confirm the skill is active, run the list command:

```bash
gemini skills list
```
*You should see `curriculum-designer` in the output.*

### 4. Activate in Session
If you are already in a chat session, you must reload the skills to use the new one:

```
/skills reload
```

## 🧠 Step-by-Step Workflow

The skill guides you through a rigorous design process for every module in your course. Here is exactly what happens when you use it.

### Step 1: Topic Discovery
You simply provide the high-level topic.
> **User:** "I want to teach a module on Deterministic Finite Automata."

### Step A: Prerequisites Analysis
The agent analyzes your topic and automatically suggests a list of potential foundational concepts needed to understand it. It then asks you how to handle each one.
> **Agent:** "For DFA, what about Set Theory? Formal Languages? Graph Theory?"
> **User:** `b, i, a`
> *   **b (Briefly Cover):** Do a quick recap.
> *   **i (Include):** Teach this as a full preliminary lesson.
> *   **a (Assume Known):** Skip it; students should already know this.

### Step B: Core Concept Refinement
The agent proposes the core learning objectives for the module. You refine the depth of coverage for each.
> **Agent:** "Should we cover the Formal 5-tuple Definition? The Subset Construction Algorithm?"
> **User:** `e, c, s`
> *   **e (Emphasize):** This is critical. Spend extra time/slides on it.
> *   **c (Cover):** Teach it normally.
> *   **s (Skip):** Remove this from the curriculum.

### Step C: Teaching Plan & Activities
The agent synthesizes your choices into a structured Lesson Plan. It then suggests **Active Learning Activities** tailored to the content.
> **Agent:** "For the 'Visualizing DFAs' lesson, should we add a 'Draw-your-own' workshop?"
> **User:** "Yes, and add a group critique session."

*The agent writes the detailed plan to `teaching-plan.md`.*

### Step D: Delivery & Implementation Strategy
Once the educational content is defined, the skill shifts focus to **Delivery**. It acts as a CTO/Lead Developer to help you build the course materials.
> **Agent:** "Now that we have the plan, how do you want to deliver it? A Web App? Slides? Notebooks?"
> **User:** "An Interactive Web App."

The agent generates a `delivery-plan.md` containing:
*   **Tech Stack:** (e.g., Next.js, React Flow, Tailwind).
*   **Asset List:** (e.g., "Need JSON schema for DFA definition").
*   **Development Roadmap:** A step-by-step guide to coding the application.

## 🏆 Case Study: Building the "CS336 Portal"

We used this exact skill to build a complete course on **Program Analysis for Security & Privacy**.

### The Challenge
We needed to teach complex topics like **Static Taint Analysis**, **Symbolic Execution**, and **Control-Flow Integrity** to advanced students.

### The Process
1.  **Curriculum Generation:** We used the Step A-C workflow to define 9 rigorous modules, choosing to *Emphasize* formal logic while *Briefly Covering* basic coding skills.
2.  **Content Enrichment:** The skill researched "Deep Dive" explanations for every key takeaway, generating rich analogies (e.g., comparing Control-Flow Graphs to subway maps).
3.  **Delivery Planning (Step D):** We chose to build a web portal. The skill generated a roadmap for a **Next.js + Monaco Editor + React Flow** platform.

### The Result
Using the plans generated by this skill, we implemented a fully functional educational portal.

## 🛠️ Cross-Platform Support (Claude)

This skill isn't just for Gemini. We believe in agentic interoperability.

The repository includes:
*   `claude_tool_definition.json`: A JSON schema defining the curriculum design tool.
*   `claude_system_prompt.md`: A system prompt containing the pedagogical logic.

You can paste these into the **Anthropic Workbench** or use them with the Claude API to replicate this powerful workflow with Claude models.
