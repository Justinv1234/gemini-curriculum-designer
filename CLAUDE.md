## Teaching Mode

For every project, you MUST create and maintain a file called `FOR_WEIHAO.md`
(or your name) that explains this project in plain language.

### Required Content

1. **Technical Architecture** - How the system is designed and why
2. **Codebase Structure** - What each folder/file does and how they connect
3. **Technology Choices** - What tools/libraries are used and why they were chosen
4. **Decision Reasoning** - The thinking behind key technical decisions

### Lessons Learned Section

Always include:
- Specific bugs encountered and how they were fixed
- Potential pitfalls to avoid in the future
- Insights into how experienced engineers approach these problems
- Patterns and anti-patterns discovered

### Writing Style

- Engaging, NOT boring textbook tone
- Use analogies to explain complex concepts
- Include anecdotes that make information memorable
- Write as if explaining to a curious junior developer
- Make it something you'd actually want to read
