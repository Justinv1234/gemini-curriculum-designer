# Pedagogical Patterns for Curriculum Design

## 1. Problem-First (Concrete-to-Abstract)
- Start with a concrete, relatable, and motivating problem
- Let the student grapple with the "why" before introducing the "how"
- Once the problem is well understood, introduce the abstract theory or tools needed to solve it
- Best for: introducing new, complex topics

## 2. Theory-to-Practice (Abstract-to-Concrete)
- Start by introducing the formal theory, definitions, and framework
- Build the intellectual toolkit first, then apply that toolkit to a practical example
- Best for: more mathematically-inclined or formal topics

## 3. Scaffolding / Simple-to-Complex
- Introduce a concept in its simplest possible form
- Once the student grasps the basic idea, progressively add layers of complexity, features, or edge cases
- Best for: almost all teaching scenarios — core best practice

## 4. Recap and Refresh
- Begin a new module by briefly reviewing essential concepts from previous lessons that are prerequisites
- Connects new material to prior knowledge
- Best for: start of every new module that builds on previous ones
