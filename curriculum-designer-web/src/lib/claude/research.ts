- **Target Audience:** ${AUDIENCE_LABELS[courseInfo.audience]}
- **Format:** ${FORMAT_LABELS[courseInfo.format]}
- **Teaching Philosophy:** ${PHILOSOPHY_LABELS[courseInfo.philosophy]}

Please generate TWO sections:

## SECTION 1: Topic Landscape

Provide a comprehensive "Topic Landscape" for this subject:

### Current Trends
- List 4-6 current trends and developments in this field with brief explanations

### Essential Tools & Technologies
- List 4-6 essential tools, frameworks, or technologies with why they matter

### Recommended Resources
- List 4-6 high-quality books, courses, or online resources

### Industry Context
- Explain how this topic is used in practice (2-3 paragraphs)

## SECTION 2: Suggested Module Breakdown

Based on the course specifications above, suggest a complete module breakdown. For a ${FORMAT_LABELS[courseInfo.format].toLowerCase()} format targeting ${AUDIENCE_LABELS[courseInfo.audience].toLowerCase()}, propose 5-8 modules:

For each module, provide:
1. Module number and title
2. One-line description
3. Estimated duration

Format as a numbered list. Each module should build logically on the previous ones, following scaffolding principles.
